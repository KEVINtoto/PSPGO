Here is code repository for protein automatic function prediction model PSPGO. 

**PSPGO** is a cross-species heterogeneous network propagation method, which can **P**ropagate feature and label information on **S**equence similarity (SS) network and **P**PI network for predicting **G**ene **O**ntology terms. The model is evaluated on a large multi-species dataset split based on time, and is compared with several state-of-the-art methods. The results show that PSPGO has good performance on multi-species test set and also performs well in prediction for single species.
